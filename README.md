# Sky Writing
This web application detects a blue circular object. Following which the path of the object is traced to obtain an image of a letter or word. This is then processed using the Google Vision API to obtain the text in the image.

The text can then be saved to Firestore by a button click. This text is then loaded into a JS application which displays it using augmented reality against a preset surface.
